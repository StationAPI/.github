<h3 align="center">A platform for accessing IoT data from all over the globe</h3>

## Intro
Station is a platform for accessing sensor data from IoT devices all over the world. Makers upload their sensor data, and consumers can use the API to access the data.

## How it Works
- Anyone with an embedded device that collects sensor data such as temperature can upload it to Station via the API
- Consumers are billed monthly based on the number of requests they make (the first 100 every month being free)
- People who upload data get paid monthly based on how much their data is requested
